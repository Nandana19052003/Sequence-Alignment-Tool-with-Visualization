# Sequence Alignment using Needleman-Wunsch and Smith-Waterman Algorithms

Sequence alignment is a fundamental problem in bioinformatics used to identify similarities and differences between biological sequences. The Needleman-Wunsch and Smith-Waterman algorithms are popular dynamic programming algorithms used for global and local sequence alignment, respectively. In this project, we implemented both algorithms, compared their performances on different datasets, and analyzed their accuracy, computational complexity, and memory requirements.


Implemented the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm to perform global sequence alignment.
Implemented the Smith-Waterman algorithm to perform local sequence alignment.
Utilized dynamic programming to compute the alignment scores and traceback paths.
